## Project Overview


In this project, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning are applied to build a pipeline that, given an image of a dog,  will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed and if supplied an image of a human, will identify the resembling dog breed. If the algorithm can't identify the image as a human or dog, it will say so. This use case is a fun exercise for anyone getting started with image classification. 

An examples is given below:

### Motivation
By exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I have made important design decisions about the user experience for my app. After completing this lab, I have deepened my understanding of the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.
